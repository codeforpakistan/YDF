## Description

This project is a Flask-based API that utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to detect discrimination in PDF documents across various communities. Discrimination detection is a crucial task for promoting fairness and equality. The API allows users to upload PDF documents, extracts text from them, and analyzes the text using GPT-3 to determine the presence of discrimination.

## Features

- Accepts PDF files as input.
- Uses the OpenAI GPT-3 language model for discrimination detection.
- Provides discrimination detection results for various communities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- OpenAI Python Library
- A valid OpenAI API key (obtain from the OpenAI website)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codeforpakistan/YDF.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key:

   Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key in the `app.py` file:

   ```python
   openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

## Usage

To use the API:

1. Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Access the API via a web browser or API client.

## Endpoints

- `GET /`: Provides a web interface for uploading PDF files.
- `POST /detect_discrimination`: Accepts a PDF file, extracts text, and analyzes it for discrimination using the OpenAI GPT-3 model.

## Example

To detect discrimination in a PDF document, use the `/detect_discrimination` endpoint with a PDF file:

1. Upload a PDF document through the web interface.
2. Submit the form to analyze the document.
3. The API will return the result: "Discrimination detected" or "No discrimination detected."

## Configuration

You can configure the API behavior by modifying the `app.py` file. You can adjust parameters like the GPT-3 model used, prompt, and response handling.

## Deployment

Deploy your Flask application to a web server or a cloud platform for production use. Ensure that your server environment meets the prerequisites and installation requirements mentioned above.
